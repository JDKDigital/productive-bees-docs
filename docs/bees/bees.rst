It's all about the bees 
=======================

**There are several different types of bees.**

*Hive bees*, which can live it either a standard,
basic hive,  or in the advanced one.

*Wild bees*,  which can be found out and about in
the world living in nests,  but which can also
live in hives as well.

Then of course we have the loners,  the *solitary bees*
which will only live in nests.

There are also *modded bees* available as well,
which can supply things such as copper,  tin,
and other resources.
