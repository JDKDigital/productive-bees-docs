Solitary Bees
=============

These bees are only found roaming in the wild.

If you are having trouble finding the bees you need, you always craft nests yourself for bees to move into.
*Remember* That if you place an artificial nest down, you *must* prime it with a Honey Treat!
The more treats used to prime it, the faster bees are attracted to it.
