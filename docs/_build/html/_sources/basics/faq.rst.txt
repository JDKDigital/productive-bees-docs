**Q: Why do my bees not go into my hive?**

Most of the bees found in the overworld are solitary bees and will
not live in a hive. They need nests to live in, don't produce
resources and are mostly used for breeding other bees.  Each bee 
has specific flower requirements, make sure they are met. 

Flower requirements can bee seen in JEI by right clicking or
pressing 'U' on the bee If your bees were living in a different 
hive, they might still remember it as their home. Put the bee in a
cage and release it while sneaking next to the new hive.

**Q: How to get X bee?**

Most of the bees are obtained from breeding two other bees together,
recipes for breeding can be found in JEI or the Big Book of Bees.
Solitary and wild bees are obtained from nests found around the world.
You can make a new bee move into a nest by placing the nest in the 
right biome and then use one or more Honey Treats on the nest.
