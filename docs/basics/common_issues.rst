.. _Common Issues:

------------------

*Why do my bees not go into my hive?*
- Most of the bees found in the overworld are solitary bees and will not live in a hive. They need nests to live in, don't produce resources and are mostly used for breeding other bees.
- Each bee has specific flower requirements, make sure they are met. Flower requirements can bee seen in JEI by right clicking or pressing 'U' on the bee
- If your bees were living in a different hive, they might still remember it as their home. Put the bee in a cage and release it while sneaking next to the new hive.

*How to get X bee?*
- Most of the bees are obtained from breeding two other bees together, recipes for breeding can be found in JEI or the Big Book of Bees.
- Solitary and wild bees are obtained from nests found around the world. You can make a new bee move into a nest by placing the nest in the right biome and then use one or more Honey Treats on the nest

*How to get a Neon Cuckoo or  a Nomad Bee*
- Neon Cuckoo and Nomad bees are cuckoo bees and will only spawn from nests of other bees. Neon Cuckoo bee will spawn from the nest of a Blue Banded Bee and Nomad bees from the nest of an Ashy Mining Bee
