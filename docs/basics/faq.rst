--------------------------

If you find yourself stuck, or with some weird issues,
here are some things you should check over first.
Bee-cause there is a chance someone has already asked
that question before...  possibly many times over.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Q: Why do my bees not go into my hive?
- Most of the bees found in the overworld are solitary bees and will not live in a hive. They need nests to live in, don't produce resources and are mostly used for breeding other bees.
- Each bee has specific flower requirements, make sure they are met. Flower requirements can bee seen in JEI by right clicking or pressing 'U' on the bee
- If your bees were living in a different hive, they might still remember it as their home. Put the bee in a cage and release it while sneaking next to the new hive.
- If all else fails, try breaking the hive and place it again. Bees stay in the hive when broken, no need for silk touch.

**Q: How to get X bee?
- Most of the bees are obtained from breeding two other bees together, recipes for breeding can be found in JEI or the Big Book of Bees.
- Solitary and wild bees are obtained from nests found around the world. You can make a new bee move into a nest by placing the nest in the right biome and then use one or more Honey Treats on the nest. Each additional treat will lower the countdown by 10%.
- Some bees can only be obtained by crafting their spawn egg. Check JEI for the recipe if this is the case.
- Primasrine bees can be fished from oceans.

**Q: How to get a Neon Cuckoo or a Nomad Bee
- Neon Cuckoo and Nomad bees are cuckoo bees and will only spawn from nests of other bees. Neon Cuckoo bee will spawn from the nest of a Blue Banded Bee and Nomad bees from the nest of an Ashy Mining Bee. There's a chance for a cuckoo bee to spawn each time the other bee brings back nectar, so make sure you have flowers around.

**Q: How do I get Skeletal or Zombees
- Skeletal and ZomBees spawn during the night in empty advanced hives left in the dark
- The spawn rate is rather low, so set up 6-8 hives in the dark and make sure the hives are chunkloaded

**Q: I can't find vanilla bees!!!

from Minecraft wiki:
"As of Java Edition 1.15.2, occupied bee nests additionally have a 5% chance to spawn on oak or birch trees in any biome that were grown from saplings within two blocks of any flower at the same y-level. With a bit of luck and a large enough supply of oak or birch saplings and bone meal, one can obtain bees relatively easily without having to travel, by repeatedly growing trees near flowers until one spawns a bee nest as it grows. This is also an ideal way to obtain bees in older worlds created prior to Java Edition 1.15, as it saves players from having to locate anything."

**Q: How do I summon and kill bees
Most of the bees are NBT based and will need more detailed commands to summon and kill
- /kill @e[type=productivebees:configurable_bee, name="Diamond Bee"]
- /summon productivebees:configurable_bee ~ ~ ~ {"type":"productivebees:diamond"}

**Q: How do I get bee genes for the Incubator
Put a piston above a bottler with bottles in it, squash the bee you want the genes of and you get a bottle of squashed bee. Put that in the centrifuge and you get the different bee attributes as genes as well as a bee type gene.
Type genes can be combined with a honey treat and used in the Incubator to make spawn eggs of that type.
The other genes can be put on honey treats and fed to other bees to transfer the attributes.

**Q: How to get Nocturnal and Metaturnal bees
Leash a Diurnal bee to something during night and it has a chance to turn Nocturnal
Leash a Nocturnal bee during day and it has a chance to turn Metaturnal
Be careful though as they can take damage with leashed in an environment they are not accustomed to

**Q: How to improve weather tolerance
Leash a bee outside during rain or storm and the bee might become accustomed to the weather
Be careful as it may take damage while leashed in a hostile environment
