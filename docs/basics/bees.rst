**It's all about the bees**


Cooldown for breeding the bees is the same as is in 'nilla.


There are several different types of bees.

------------------------------------------

*Hive bees*, which can live it either a standard, basic hive, or in the advanced one. Resources will only be produced when living in an :ref:`Advanced Hive<advanced hive>`.

*Wild bees*, which can be found out and about in the world living in naturally spawning nests. Wild bees can live both in their natural nests and in hives as well.

*Solitary bees*, the loners. Found living in solitary nests found around the overworld. Solitary bees will not live in hives together with other bees and do not produce any resources.

*Worker bees*, a special breed of hive bees which are trained to do specific jobs like harvesting crops and gathering resources.

Among the hive bees are also *modded bees*, which can supply things added by other mods, such as copper, tin, and mod-specific resources.
