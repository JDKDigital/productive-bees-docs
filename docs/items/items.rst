Bee Cage

Honey Treat
-----------
Feeding this to an angry bee will calm it down. It will also heal the 
bee and if the bees is a child, it will boost the growth a little.

Honey treats can be used as a way to transfer attributes from one bee 
to another. see :ref:`Squashed Bee Material<Squashed Bee Material>` for more info.


Squashed Bee Material
---------------------
Bottles of Squashed Bee Material contains a mix of genetics from a bee.
 You can get a bees genetic material by first squashing the bee into a 
 bottle using a piston on top of a bottler. Make sure the bottler has 
 empty bottles and then contain the bee you wish to extract genes from 
 between the bottler and the piston. Bottles are small, bees are big so 
 it takes a lot of force to get it in. Bees usually do not survive this 
 kind of treatment.

Take your squashed bee material to the centrifuge and extract gene samples 
for each of the bees attributes. Combine a gene sample with a honey treat 
and feed it to a bee to transfer the gene.

Squishy!
