Withered bees are closely related to [Skeletal Bees](skeletal-bee).

If you feed a Withered Rose to a Skeletal Bee, it will turn into it's withered variant.

Withered Bees produce [Withered Combs](comb#withered) which can be put into a [Centrifuge](centrifuge) to get [Wither Skull Chips](wither-skull-chip). These chips can be crafted into Wither Skulls.
